# IJC437-Introduction-to-Data-Science-Project

This project investigates whether a song’s audio characteristics can predict its likelihood of entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Using combined Billboard (1999–2023) and Spotify audio feature data, the analysis applies descriptive statistics and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost).
The results show that loudness and energy are the most consistent predictors of chart success, while overall predictive performance highlights the limits of audio features alone in explaining musical popularity.
